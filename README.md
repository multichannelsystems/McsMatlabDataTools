# McsMatlabDataTools: The McsHDF5 Matlab Toolbox

The [McsHDF5 Matlab toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54976-mcsmatlabdatatools) can be used to import HDF5 files generated by software from Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH. Importing the HDF5 files via this toolbox allows easy access to all data and metadata in the HDF5 files, as well as basic plotting functions for the streams and datasets in the file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This Toolbox has been tested for Matlab 2009a and newer. Matlab versions older than R2011a might have reduced functionality, because they need to use the old ``hdf5info`` functions instead of the newer ``h5info`` functions. In particular, it might not be possible to open result files generated by CMOS-MEA-Tools in Matlab R2010b and older.

### Installing

The most convenient way to install the Toolbox is via Matlab's **Add-On Explorer**. If you are using an older Matlab version without this functionality, please check the **Installation** page in the Wiki for more information.

### Compatible Files

This toolbox opens HDF5 files generated by the [Multi Channel DataManager](https://www.multichannelsystems.com/software/multi-channel-datamanager) software. It also opens files generated by the [CMOS-MEA-Control](https://www.multichannelsystems.com/software/multi-channel-datamanager) software version 2 and newer, as well as the [CMOS-MEA-Tools](https://www.multichannelsystems.com/software/cmos-mea-tools) software version 2 and newer. Please see the respective sections in this Help file browser for either files generated by the DataManager or the CMOS-MEA software.

### Documentation

In addition to the usual help functions of the Matlab command line, documentation for all functions and classes in this package is provided by the Matlab help browser:

```Matlab

```
